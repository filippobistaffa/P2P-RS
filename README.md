===================
Welcome to the repository of P2P-RS, i.e., the algorithm presented by Filippo Bistaffa, Christian Blum, Jesús Cerquides, Alessandro Farinelli, and Juan Rodrı́guez-Aguilar in “[A Computational Approach to Quantify the Benefits of Ridesharing for Policy Makers and Travellers](http://hdl.handle.net/10261/194874)”, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (IEEE T-ITS) volume 22 issue 1, 2021, DOI: [10.1109/TITS.2019.2954982](https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2019.2954982).

The source code of P2P-RS is available upon request. If you are interested, feel free to contact me at filippo [dot] bistaffa [at] iiia [dot] csic [dot] es.

Real-world Data 
----------
P2P-RS employs the [TLC Trip Record Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) provided by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). In the experimental evaluation of our publication we use data from one week-end day (3 December 2016) and one week day (1 December 2016).
